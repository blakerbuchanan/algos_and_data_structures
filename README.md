# Algorithm and Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various standard algorithms and data structures used in computer science and robotics.

## Installing datastructures package
Developed using *Python 3.8.1*

#### Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```
virtualenv -p python3 ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, ksh, or zsh
```

#### Install datastructures
Run
```
pip install -e .
```

## Testing algorithms 
Most of the algorithm implementations should contain an example and be runnable as a script on its own for verifying their functionality. Feel free to design your own example and test it out.
